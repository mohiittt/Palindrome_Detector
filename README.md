# Palindrome_Detector

Today's challenge is all about palindromes.

A palindrome is a word that is symmetrical, (i.e. it reads the same backwards as forwards).

For example:

racecar
madam
radar

### You're going to write a program that checks a string to see if it is a palindrome.

Your program should:

1. Prompt the user to input a word.
2. Analyze the word to see if it is a palindrome.
3. Output a relevant 'yes/no message.
